== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is PressTrend a free service? =

Yup! The core WordPress plugin is currently free. If you're looking to receive social and eCommerce data, you can upgrade anytime.

= What's the real value of PressTrends? =

Content creators have been asking about the secrets to building a successful blog for a while now. The web hasn't had a widely adopted platform to really aggregate trends across and get those insights, until now. With WordPress powering over 17% of the web, we now have a huge platform to get trends on interactions and content. 

PressTrends delivers those insights and trends to blogs and content creators. This allows everyone to identify areas of improvement and isolate trends that typically encourage adoption. Further, PressTrends makes your analytics data simple and actionable.

Not at all. PressTrends is also used by theme and plugin authors to see how they can improve design, development, and overall feature sets for better products. Learn more by visiting [PressTrends](http://www.presstrends.io/).
